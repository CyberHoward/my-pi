### Code AST (`ast_references`, `ast_rename`, `ast_symbols`)

TypeScript-aware code intelligence. Falls back to ripgrep for non-TS/JS files.

- `ast_references` — Find all references to a symbol
- `ast_rename` — Rename a symbol across the codebase (applies edits)
- `ast_symbols` — List all symbols in a file (functions, classes, types, etc.)
