### Subagents (`subagent`)

Delegate tasks to specialized subagents with isolated context windows.

**Modes:**
- Single: `{ agent: "scout", task: "find all auth code" }`
- Parallel: `{ tasks: [{ agent: "scout", task: "..." }, ...] }` (up to 8 tasks, 4 concurrent)
- Chain: `{ chain: [{ agent: "scout", task: "..." }, { agent: "planner", task: "Based on: {previous}" }] }`

**Workflow prompts:** `/implement`, `/scout-and-plan`, `/implement-and-review`

Use subagents for:
- Scouting unfamiliar codebases before planning
- Delegating independent implementation tasks
- Code review after completing work
- Parallel investigation of unrelated problems

Available agents are listed in the **Agents** section below.
